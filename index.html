        <h2>About Project</h2>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Have you ever felt lonely because DT is such a diverse community but there's no one like you?</li>
            <li>Are you an
                aspiring artist, UIUX person, or creative technologist looking for a similar cohort?</li>
            <li>Or you may be someone
                who simply wanna get out of the bubble and make new friends?</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>The project is here for you!</p>

        <p>Hi, I'm Munus. <span>[: DT soulmate matcher :]</span> is an uncorporate data visualization project I did in
            the 2022
            Spring Major Studio 2 class taught by Sven Travis.</p>
        <p>The project utilizes generative designs and a custom
            algorithm to experiment with a new way of facilitating community building.</p>

        <br><br>

        <h2>How to Read</h2>
        <br>
        <p>By collecting data from 45 community members in the <a
                href="https://www.newschool.edu/parsons/mfa-design-technology/">Parsons Design and Technology MFA
                program</a>, I was able
            to
            craft customized data identities for each one of them and paired them up with at least one soulmate
            using a
            self-made soulmate matcher algorithm.</p>

        <p>Every card here represents an active community member in the program, you can unfold their card to learn
            more
            about them. You can also switch between <span>similarity</span>, <span>grid</span>, and
            <span>soulmate</span> modes. In similarity mode,
            everyone
            is arranged by how similar to one another, the closer they are, the similar they are in terms of skills
            and
            interests. In soulmate mode, you will be able to see who is being paired with whom in the matching.</p>
